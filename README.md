## Description
This is a simple and straightforward `React` and `Redux` application in which you can play a list of songs and get the details of each of them. For styling, this has `Semantic-UI`.
The goal is to understand how `React` and `Redux` work together.

###  Components
The app is broken out in two separate components:

### `SongList`
It takes a list of songs (array of objects) and renders them.

### `SongDetail`
It displays the title and the length of the song selected.
